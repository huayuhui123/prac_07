Name:a1_classes
Date started:2021.11.17
Introduce:These functions can help you know information of albums you have.You can chose "L" to
          see them,or choose "A" to add new albums ,or choose "M" to mark the condition from "r"
          to "c".When you choose "Q",you can get out of this function and you can know how many
          albums you have saved.Different from A1,albums in A2 are stored in a list of instantiated
          album objects,so something will be changed.
